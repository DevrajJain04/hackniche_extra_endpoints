Scene 1:

EXT. CHOWPATTY BEACH - SUNSET

The golden Mumbai sunset bathes Chowpatty Beach in a warm glow. The air is thick with the aroma of roasted peanuts, bhel puri, and the salty sea. RAJU's small chai and vada pav stall is nestled amidst the bustling crowd. He's sweating, juggling orders, and trying to keep his rickety stove from sputtering out.

RAJU
(Calling out)
Ek cutting chai, strong! Aur do vada pav, garma garam!

A group of college students laugh and jostle near his stall. MAYA, with a camera slung around her neck, captures the scene. A stray cricket ball, hit from a nearby improvised game, flies straight towards Raju's stall, landing squarely in a plate of freshly made vada pav.

RAJU
(Yelping)
Aiyyo! Yeh kya hai?!

He pulls the ball out, his fingers covered in chutney. The college students apologize, but Raju is fuming.

MAYA
(Approaching, smiling)
That was quite a shot.

RAJU
(Wiping his hands)
Shot? Meri vada pav ki shot! Aur yeh dekho, sab chutney lag gaya!

He angrily throws the ball back towards the group. It flies straight, with an unexpected spin, hitting a distant coconut stall's target perfectly. Maya’s eyes widen.

MAYA
(To herself, snapping a photo)
Wow.

RAJU
(Confused)
Kya wow? Meri vada pav barbaad ho gaya.

MAYA
(Pointing)
That throw. The spin. It was… amazing.

Raju looks in the direction of the coconut stall, surprised. He shrugs, dismissing it.

RAJU
Just lucky.

Scene 2:

EXT. DADAR RAILWAY STATION PLATFORM - DAY

The platform is a whirlwind of activity. Crowds surge, vendors hawk their wares, and trains thunder in and out. Raju, now carrying a small bag, nervously navigates the chaos. He's followed Maya's directions to find Anna, a local cricket coach.

He spots a weathered man, ANNA, sitting on a bench, reading a newspaper. Anna has a stern face and a thick mustache.

RAJU
(Approaching hesitantly)
Excuse me, Anna sir?

Anna lowers his newspaper, his eyes scanning Raju.

ANNA
Haan? Kaun hai tu?

RAJU
Mera naam Raju hai. Maya ne bheja. Woh… woh cricket ball wala.

Anna's eyes narrow. He remembers the incident Maya described.

ANNA
Cricket ball wala? Toh tu hai woh? Dikha kya hai tere paas.

Raju, flustered, pulls out a worn-out tennis ball from his bag. He throws it, trying to replicate the spin he accidentally produced at Chowpatty. The ball wobbles and lands awkwardly.

ANNA
(Scoffs)
Yeh kya hai? Gadha bhi achcha phekta hai.

RAJU
(Desperate)
Sir, woh uss din… woh thoda alag tha.

ANNA
Alag? Toh alag dikha.

Raju, under pressure, throws the ball again. This time, he instinctively grips it differently, and the ball spins with a sharp, unexpected curve. Anna's eyes light up.

ANNA
(Grunting)
Phir se.

Scene 3:

EXT. SHIVAJI PARK CRICKET GROUND - EVENING

The sprawling Shivaji Park cricket ground is alive with the sounds of bat and ball. Raju, now wearing a borrowed cricket kit, stands at the bowling crease. Anna watches him intently from behind the stumps.

ANNA
(Calling out)
Line aur length! Control!

Raju bowls. The ball spins, deceiving the batsman, who edges it. Anna nods, a rare hint of approval on his face.

MAYA
(From the sidelines, snapping photos)
He's got it!

Raju bowls again and again, each delivery showing improvement. He's found his rhythm, his natural talent shining through.

ANNA
(To Maya, a hint of a smile)
Yeh ladka, isme dum hai.

RAJU
(Wiping sweat, grinning)
Sir, yeh sab vada pav ki shakti hai!

He looks towards the setting sun, a sense of hope and possibility filling him. The sounds of cricket, the buzz of the city, and the taste of his own success blend into a symphony of Mumbai life.

FADE OUT.
